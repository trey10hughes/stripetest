Very basic stripe charging

If you want to view the charges you make in test mode, make a stripe account and you can view it in your dashboard under "Payments", but you'll have to replace the public and secret keys with your own. 

When we integrate this into our app it'll be best if we just make an account specifically for the app and use that so we can all see the same thing and we won't have to change the keys every time we push to or pull from github.
